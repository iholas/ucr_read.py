# ucr_read.py
_UNIFINISHED_ A Python script for processing, cleaning, and aggregating FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data

This is a work in progress. I am porting the urc_read SAS macro.  You can see the details of that macro here. https://github.com/iholas/ucr_read/wiki

For now, this reads in the data and cleans them. There is more that need to be done to finish cleaning. Ultimately, I will include aggregation from agency-level to state-level as is the case in the SAS macro
