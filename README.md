# ucr_read.py
_UNIFINISHED_ A Python script for processing, cleaning, and aggregating FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data

This is a work in progress. I am porting the urc_read SAS macro.  You can see the details of that macro here. https://github.com/iholas/ucr_read/wiki

The python code that is present works and works correctly. However, the functionality is incomplete. For now, this reads in the data and perfrorms various cleaning steps. There is more that need to be done to finish cleaning, however. Ultimately, I will include aggregation from agency-level to state-level as is the case in the SAS macro. You can see the leftover SAS code at the bottom of the file (in comment) to see the functionaloty that still needs to be added.
